#Good Practices || Important points

- In react the functions are parsed into a predefined format as a tree and then they are render
- In our react lib we define our format and and take a container in which we put the HTML part and then define a render function and created domElement using createElement() function and then take props as attribute to fill the element
- we can not run our custom schema inn react as we are defining here our custom render function to render it so that it takes reactelement and put it into container
- to represent variable {} this is used to inject varibale and this is called Evaluated Expression and only contains the final value value of variable not the complete code to find the variable
