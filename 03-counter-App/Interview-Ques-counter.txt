if:
    const addValue=()=>{
      setCount(counter+1)
      setCount(counter+1)
      setCount(counter+1)
      setCount(counter+1)
  }

  will this add the value by 4?


ANS-  No, in this the function will run in batch in which all the counters are same and only 1 will be increased as in react fiber take 
      this responsiblity to update all the updates in batches so that it will be more efficient



SO:
  Now if you want to increase it my 4?

ANS: Then the setCount method accepts a callback in which we can pass the statement 4 time to increse it by 4 as:

    const addValue=()=>{
      setCount((counter)=>counter+1)
      setCount((counter)=>counter+1)
      setCount((counter)=>counter+1)
      setCount((counter)=>counter+1)
  }

  like this it take these 4 statemment as diff batches to be performed respectively.
